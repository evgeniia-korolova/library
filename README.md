This project was created as part of the RS School program in 2023 under the Library branch.
Since I am no longer a student of this school, I decided to enhance the project by adding new functionality.

 The changes include:

 * Registration or Login forms that appear when you click the "Buy"   button, depending on the user's status.
  * The addition of "Unsubscribe" buttons.
  * Possibility to register under different accounts


Final changes, such as Perfect Pixel compliance and improvements to the Digital Card interface, are still in progress as far as refactoring of the code.

I am also considering adding a feature that allows users to return books to the library and changing the "Buy" button to "Rent."
